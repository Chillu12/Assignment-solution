O7.Are there cases where I must use a for loop but not a while, or vice versa?
In general, you should use for loop when you know how many times the loop should run. If you want the loop to break
based on a condition other than number of times it runs, you should use while loop.

Typically,

<initialization>
while(<condition>) {
...
<updation>
}

is equivalent to:

for(<initialization>;<condition>;<updation>)
{
    ....
}
