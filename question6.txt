Q6 Can I use a double variable as a loop-control variable in a for loop?

It is fine to use a double variable as a loop-control variable, especially if you want to loop through
fractional values or increment by fractional values.

However it is advisable not to use "==" to compare for the condition to end the loop. Due to precision errors
this can easily result in an infinite loop in spite of the best intentions. That's why we need to use "<=".

Besides, if the value of a double control variable is too large, it's not a good idea to use it in the for loop.
